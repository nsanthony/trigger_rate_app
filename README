These are notes when I installed ROOT and got root-numpy to work on anaconda with Ubuntu 16.04:

- Used miniconda3 to run the python necessary and conda install and pip install to get modules
- Needed to conda install libgcc

- Needed to have ROOT make with this command after you make /urs/local/root directory and build it in a seperate directory from both the source and destination (this includes python dependancy):
	sudo cmake ~/Downloads/root-6.08.06 -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/home/nsanthony/anaconda3/bin/python 
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local/root
	
	* ~/Downloads/root-6.09.06 is the directory where you unzipped root download


-Install root-numpy with pip (does not work on mac system)
-Need to put data in /home/nsanthony/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/root_numpy/testdata


-GUI built using PyQT5


-root_scripts needs to be put in the L0data directory
-new root files put in the data_root directory located in the trigger_rate_app directory
